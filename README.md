NLP CLASSIFICATION
Used model:
1. Naive Bayer
2. Support Vector Machine


Overview:
Loading and Preprocessing Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps. This should include text cleaning, tokenization, and removal of stopwords. Explain the preprocessing techniques used and their impact on model performance.

Model Development Train the following machine learning models a)Naive Bayesb)Support Vector Machine

Model Comparison Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). Provide a brief explanation of the chosen model and its suitability for emotionÂ classification.
